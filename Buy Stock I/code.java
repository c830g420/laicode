//Given an array of positive integers representing a stockâ€™s price on each day. 
//On each day you can only make one operation: 
//either buy or sell one unit of stock and you can make at most 1 transaction. 
//Determine the maximum profit you can make.

//Assumptions
//
//The given array is not null and is length of at least 2.

//Examples
//
//{2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5}, the maximum profit you can make is 5 - 1 = 4





// My solution
//
